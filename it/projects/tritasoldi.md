Tritasoldi is a proof-of-work algorithm, which has been used as a denial-of-service counter measure technique in a number of systems.

A tritasoldi stamp constitutes a proof-of-work which takes a parameterizable amount of work to compute for the sender. The recipient (and indeed anyone as it is publicly auditable) can verify received hashcash stamps efficiently
